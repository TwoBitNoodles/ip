In the course of building this application, I used ChatGPT to assist with improving the GUI. 
More specifically, I used it to learn how to;
- set the background of a GUI element to an image using css and fxml, instead of just changing the color.
This was quite helpful, paired with closely referencing the javafx tutorial on how images were set in the
DialogBox.
- how and where to use globally defined colors in stylesheets.

Use of AI for non-programming related purposes:
- Fotor AI was used to extend the image set as the GUI's background.
